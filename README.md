# samples-integration-FHIR

This code shows a sample FHIR integration solution for InterSystems IRIS for Health. FHIR data can be sent over REST and stored to a FHIR repository. HL7v2 data can also be consumed, converted to FHIR and stored in the FHIR repository. This data can then be retrieved through a REST client.

Through the use of FHIR and InterSystems IRIS for Health, you can easily:

* Expose discrete resources, improving performance.
* Convert data between FHIR and many other healthcare data formats such as HL7 v2 or CDA.
* Route, and orchestrate data between multiple disparate applications.
* Store FHIR resources in a FHIR resource repository using InterSystems IRIS for Health as your FHIR application development environment.
